## What's this?
The purpose of this app is to turn a smartphone (or any Android device with Bluetooth adapter) into a remote keyboard and mouse.
It allows user to connect via Bluetooth to another android device or smart TV and control it from the couch. Thus the original name of the app was BLE CouchPotato, where BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy.
It doesn't require any software to be installed on the other side (it's serverless) it just uses Bluetooth and HID protocol to say to other devices "Hi! I'm a keyboard!"
App is free to use, it doesn't contain any ads or paywalls. It was created as a hobby project to learn Android and to be able to search for funny cats on the internet faster - typing anything on a smart TV on-screen keyboard takes an eternity.
It is available in Google Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.le.potato
